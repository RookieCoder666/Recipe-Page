              <h2>Vegetarians</h2>
              <p>
                They're people who choose not to eat meat, whether it's for
                health, ethical, or environmental reasons. Instead, they enjoy a
                diet focused on fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds.
                Being a vegetarian can have some awesome benefits, like lowering
                your risk of certain diseases, reducing your carbon footprint,
                and supporting animal welfare. Plus, there are tons of delicious
                vegetarian recipes out there that can satisfy any craving! So if
                you're thinking about giving vegetarianism a try, go for it –
                it's a cool choice that's good for you and the planet.
